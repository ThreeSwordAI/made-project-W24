Exploring Racial Bias in Traffic Policing: An Analysis of Six Eastern States of USA

## Research Question

<!-- This is the question I want find answer based on the Data I have -->
1. Are there observable patterns in traffic stop occurrences and their outcomes based on the drivers' race?

## Abstract

This research investigates the potential racial bias in traffic policing across six eastern states in the United States, utilizing data from the Stanford Open Policing Project. The analysis is based on 9,494,312 traffic stops. The search focuses on racial patterns in searches conducted, arrests made, warnings issued and contraband discoveries. Key findings show that the arrest rates are higher for Black drivers in most of the contraband categories. Although the differences in arrest rates are subtle, but the observed patterns suggest racial disparities in traffic policing, warranting further investigation.
