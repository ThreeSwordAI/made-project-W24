<!-- Title of my Project-->
Investigating Potential Racial Bias in Traffic Policing of US: An Evidence-Based Analysis

## Main Question

<!-- This is the question I want find answer based on the Data I have -->
1. Are there observable patterns in traffic stop occurrences and their outcomes based on the drivers' race?

## Description

<!-- A abstract of my project (max. 200 words. I will be answering why and how I attempt it.) -->
This project will explore potential racial patterns in traffic police behavior by analyzing traffic stops and their outcomes using data from [the Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/). By examining key factors such as stop location, driver demographics, reasons for stops and outcomes; this project aims to provide evidence based on real data regarding the equity of traffic policing practices. Given recent public discourse around racial profiling, this analysis will provide a data-driven understanding of this important topic.
